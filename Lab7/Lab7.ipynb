        "The goal of this lab is to give you an idea of how you could use agents to help with physics tasks. It will also introduce you to AutoGen, one of the more popular frameworks at the moment for designing custom agentic workflows. We won't make use of all the tools it provides, just the very basics. Note also that many of the most interesting things one can do with AI-powered agents (see topics like retreival augmented generation (RAG)) require very large models to be performant, and many techniques require continuous/repeated training. This means large resource requirements, so for this lab we will just be using a very small LLM (Llama: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0). The results from this are nowhere near as good as something like chatGPT, but it should give you an idea of how a more advanced model (or models) might be able to do something really helpful/cool. This is an area of current research, so it will be interesting to see what they can do!\n",
        "\n",
        "Also because of the limited size of the model, the text parsing needs to be very mechanical, and in some places a bit obtuse. The better (and ideally specially trained for an agentic workflow, see RAG) your model is, the more this can be relaxed. If you're interested in working with agents in a more user-friendly way (hiding a lot of the mechanics that are on display here), check out sites like n8n or Google Gemini (be aware that these can require you to provide a lot of permissions). You can also feel free to replace TinyLlama with a call to a larger model using API keys if you have some.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we would like to emphasize the use of copilot/similar tools for this lab in particular. These are agents too! And they are definitely the most performant agents you have easy access to.\n"
